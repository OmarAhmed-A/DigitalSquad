# Maze Solver and Child Rescuer

This is a project created for the Dell HackTrick2023 hackathon. The project involves solving a maze and rescuing children in the maze by solving cyber security riddles.

## Story

Initially, we attempted to use Stable Baselines to train a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, but we quickly encountered compatibility issues with the maze environment. Undeterred, we decided to build a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm from scratch using PyTorch. Unfortunately, we faced another setback as the training didn't converge, leaving us no choice but to explore other avenues.

Determined to overcome these obstacles, we opted for an algorithmic approach to solve the maze. The cybersecurity team was instrumental in the success of our project, working tirelessly to crack the riddles and unlock the paths to the children. We are immensely grateful for their efforts and contributions.

Thanks to their tireless problem-solving skills, the children were rescued, and the maze was ultimately conquered. Of course, we faced numerous challenges and bugs along the way, but our team spirit and collaboration were key to our ultimate triumph.

We are grateful for the opportunity to participate in this hackathon and proud to have contributed to its success. Thank you, Dell Center of Excellence, for this unforgettable experience. And a special thank you to the problem-solving team for their invaluable support and hard work.
